ðŸš€ Day 1 of 30 Days of Python Challenge ðŸŒŸ

Excited to kick off this journey of learning Python! Today, I completed Day 1, and hereâ€™s what I covered:

âœ… Learned about basic syntax and structure in Python.
âœ… Practiced writing my first few lines of code.
âœ… Explored foundational concepts like variables, data types, and input/output.

Feeling motivated to stay consistent and build strong programming skills over the next 30 days.

ðŸ“˜ Notebook progress: [Day 1 Notebook].
Letâ€™s see where this challenge takes me! ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥
